Text-guided diffusion models have become a popular tool in image synthesis, known for producing high-quality and diverse images. However, their application to editing real images often encounters hurdles primarily due to the text condition deteriorating the reconstruction quality and subsequently affecting editing fidelity. Null-text Inversion (NTI) has made strides in this area, but it fails to capture spatial context and requires computationally intensive per-timestep optimization. Addressing these challenges, we present NOISE MAP GUIDANCE (NMG), an inversion method rich in a spatial context, tailored for real-image editing. Significantly, NMG achieves this without necessitating optimization, yet preserves the editing quality. Our empirical investigations highlight NMGâ€™s adaptability across various editing techniques and its robustness to variants of DDIM inversions.

## NMG + Editing Methods

### Prompt-to-Prompt
The [nmg_ptp.ipynb](nmg_ptp.ipynb) is Notebook for NMG with [Prompt-to-Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01626) editing, capable of performing tasks such as  **object swap**, **contextual alterations**, **face attribute editing**, **color change**, and **global editing**. To efficiently process these tasks, it's recommended to use a GPU equipped with a minimum of 15GB of VRAM.

### MasaCtrl
The [nmg_masactrl.ipynb](nmg_masactrl.ipynb) is Notebook for NMG with [MasaCtrl](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08465) editing, capable of performing tasks such as  **viewpoint alternation**, and **pose modification**. To efficiently process these tasks, it's recommended to use a GPU equipped with a minimum of 23GB of VRAM.

### pix2pix-zero
The [nmg_pix2pix.ipynb](nmg_pix2pix.ipynb) is Notebook for NMG with [pix2pix-zero](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03027) editing, capable of performing tasks such as  **dog &rarr; cat**, and **cat &rarr; dog**. To efficiently process these tasks, it's recommended to use a GPU equipped with a minimum of 11GB of VRAM.
